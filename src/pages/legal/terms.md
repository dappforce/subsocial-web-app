Please read them carefully and let us know if you have any questions.

If you disagree with any part of these Terms of Use and you contacted us on the matter, and after our reply you still disagree, please do not access or use this Website, let us have our separate paths.

Our project is in constant development, so we reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove parts of these Terms of Use at any time. We understand they seem boring, but please check these Terms of Use periodically for changes. Because, if you continue to use the Website following any respective changes, it will mean that you agree to and accept the changes. And we do not want to deprive you of your naturally given right to disagree with any of the introduced changes.

This Website, Subsocial platform, and any and all underlying technologies are provided to you “as is” and to the extent permitted by law, we make no representations or warranties, either express or implied, regarding this Website or the platform.

## 1. Subsocial technology

Subsocial is a decentralized platform (“Platform”) based on the blockchain technology built on top of the Substrate Framework.

If you do not know what blockchain is and how distributed technologies operate, please take your time, since some of the concepts and approaches used on the Platform and represented on this Website originate in the inherent technological peculiarities of the blockchain and other distributed technologies and may be at first unfamiliar to you.

The Website is just a visible part of our Platform, created for your convenient user experience. By creating an account on the Platform, you’ll have access to certain services and products visible through our Website.

By using this Website or interacting with any content on the Platform in any way, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with cryptographic systems and acknowledge that blockchain, cryptography and other distributed technologies is a progressing field and we cannot guarantee that any breakthrough in computer technologies (e.g. quantum computing) shall not compromise our technology or any data you upload to the Platform.

The only thing we can guarantee is that, to the extent possible, we intend to update the underlying blockchain protocol of the Subsocial network to account for any advances in cryptography.

Please, keep in mind, that we are not responsible for any technical issues of the Substrate Framework, Polkadot technology, or any other third party technology, used on the Platform, including but not limited to late report by developers of representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain or any other underlying technology, including forks, technical node issues, or any other issues leading to any loses of information or funds as a result.

## 2. Beta version

These Terms of Use regulate the beta version of our Platform and this Website (collectively - “Beta”). And the main purpose of this Beta is to identify defects and obtain feedback on its performance.

Therefore, you are advised to use caution and not to rely in any way on the performance and functioning of this Beta. If after finishing the previous sentence, you are still with us, by this you acknowledge that the Beta is a test network and may contain bugs, errors and other problems that could cause inconsistent performance, loss of data stored on the Platform, systems crashes, interruptions and other failures or unpleasant malfunctioning.

We also reserve the right to amend or even withdraw the Platform, Website or any service or material we provide on the Platform and Website, in our sole discretion without any prior notice, so please do not be baffled when something like that happens.

We do not guarantee that our Platform or Website, or any technology underlying the Platform and the Website, or any content on the Platform or visible through the Website will always be available or be interrupted. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Platform and Websites or any content is unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Website or the Platform, or the entire Website and Platform, to users due to technical maintenance or upgrade of the Website or the Platform. We shall try our best to keep you informed on such issues, however we retain a right not to provide you with a prior notice for any such restrictions of access or any other interruption in the operation of the Website or the Platform.

So, as lawyers would say, your sole right and remedy as a result of dissatisfaction with the Website, Platform or any services or related content shall be your termination of access to our Website, and use of the Platform.

## 3. Eligibility

You have to be sixteen (16) years or older to use our Website and the Platform. So, by using it you represent and warrant that you are (i) at least 16 years of age at the date you are using the Website and/or the Platform, (ii) you are of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction as is required to access this Website, the Platform and any of its content; (iii) are not barred to use the Websites or the Platform under any applicable law, and (iv) are using the Websites and the Platform only for your own personal use. If you do not meet any of these requirements, please do not access or use our Websites, there is much more interesting stuff in the world you are still eligible for.

## 4. Account and Security

Since Subsocial is built on top of the distributed networking technology, there is no “Account” in the conventional meaning of this term.

In order to use any services on our Platform and Website you will need to have a pair of cryptographic public and private keys generated on your device with any compatible third-party software (e.g. Polkadot.js extension).

The backend of our Website and our Protocol do not require and will never ask you for access to your private keys.

To perform any action on our network (e.g. setting up a Space, posting, commenting, sharing, liking, and any other stuff you do on social networks) you will need Subsocial tokens credited to your Account.

For the Beta, Subsocial tokens can be requested at our Token Faucet. An actual link to the Faucet should be present on the Website.

Since our Platform is in constant development, and this is a Beta, we do not undertake or guarantee to provide any amount of the tokens to any User at any time. We reserve a right to change or amend the token distribution model, concept and approach at any time at our sole discretion without any prior notice. We do not guarantee that any links for token requests or any other method for token distribution, or any other features concerning token distribution or circulation presented on our Website will operate uninterrupted or unmodified at any time.

For the purpose of this Terms of Use - the “Account” shall mean a pair of cryptographic keys (private and public) with any amount of Subsocial tokens credited to the respective blockchain account associated with the respective public key (You see, these are the inherent peculiarities of the blockchain technology we warned you about in para. 1).

You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your Subsocial Account and any of your private keys. If you appoint a third party to control one or more of your Accounts or private keys, we shall not be responsible for the actions or omissions of such third party.

For this Beta we do not provide any functionality for restoration of an Account or private keys. All the transactions with the Subsocial tokens are irreversible.

For more detailed information on issues related to generation, storing, using and restoration of your private keys please read the respective documents (Terms of use e.g.) of the third-party software provider you are using for the management of your private keys. Yeah, we understand this means more boring reading, but believe us, it's worth it.

You are solely responsible for the security of your Polkadot.js extension account and other accounts, browsers or extensions you use to set up an Account or/and initiate transactions on the Website.

We will not be responsible or liable for any losses you incur as the result of your use of Polkadot.js extension or any such third party services or technology, including but not limited to: any losses, damages or claims arising from: (i) user error; (ii) forgotten passwords; (iii) lost private key; (iv) incorrectly construed smart contracts; (ii) node or server failure; (iii) corrupted wallet files; or (iv) unauthorized access or unlawful activities by third parties against Subsocial network, Polkadot.js extension, or any other third-party provider technologies.

## 5. Subsocial Tokens

All transactions on the Subsocial platform require Subsocial Tokens to be successfully conducted or executed. The tokens are used to allocate resources of the Platform so that decentralized applications can self-execute in a secured fashion.
Subsocial tokens are utility tokens in the meaning of the applicable legislation and shall not be considered as payment tokens, cryptocurrency or security tokens of any kind.
They are not publicly traded on any exchange and are not intended to be used as any means of value or exchange outside our Platform.
Any use of the Subsocial tokens outside our Platform for any other purposes than the Platform was initially intended for shall be performed solely at your own risk.
We do not guarantee any value of the Subsocial denominated in any other crypto of fiat currency.
We do not refund, return, reimburse, compensate or otherwise indemnify you any of the Subsocial tokens in the event of including but not limited to: (i) any losing of funds; or (ii) improper disposal of funds as a result of forgotten passwords to the user’s wallet, theft, fraudulent activities of any other the Users or any third parties.
With greater freedom comes greater responsibility, on a blockchain, you are the only one responsible for your funds.

## 6. Acceptable use
